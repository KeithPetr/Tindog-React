# Tindog
## A Scrimba FrontEnd Developer Path Project

The project re-creates the Tinder app. It allows a user to like or pass on different profiles.
When a profile is liked, the user can then send a message to that profile. The app keeps track
of sent messages and allows the user to navigate between liked profiles, un-selected profiles
and messages.

## Project Requirements
The Salesboard project required us to follow a Figma design
and build the layout using CSS and HTML from scratch.
We were required to use JavaScript functions, arrays, loops
and objects to create the functionality.

## This project includes the following 'stretch goals':
  - Toggle for light and dark modes
  - Storing the data in the browser
  - Create a button to reset the data
