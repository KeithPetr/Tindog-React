# Tindog
## A Scrimba FrontEnd Developer Path Project

The project re-creates the Tinder app. It allows a user to like or pass on different profiles.
When a profile is liked, the user can then send a message to that profile. The app keeps track
of sent messages and allows the user to navigate between liked profiles, un-selected profiles
and messages. In the header, the user can click on the profile icon to see liked profiles, the
paw icons to see un-selected profiles, and the chat icon to see currently sent messages.

## Project Requirements
The Tindog app orginally was designed to use Javascript classes to create the like and nope
tags on each profile and track which profiles had been liked. I created this project using
the React library to re-create that same functionality while also adding on top of it. I was 
able to add components and states that allowed for the user to navigate through liked profiles, 
un-selected profiles, and messages that have currently been sent by the user.

## This project includes the following 'stretch goals':
  - Toggle between liked profiles, profiles, and current messages
  - Displaying the most recent message if available
  - Determining which profile inputs have already been selected
  - Keeping a history of sent messages

## Future Goals
  - Add ability to respond to messages
  - On page refresh, keep history of chats and liked profiles
